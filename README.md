# this looks great. Do include more info on testing - tested each action event for proper functionality, etc.
#  I am not sure why the car would jump....

# Exercise 15.29
Write a program that simulates car racing, as shown in Figure 15.34a. The car moves from left to right. When it hits the right end, it   restarts from the left and continues the same process. You can use a timer to control animation. Redraw the car with a new base coordinates (x, y), as shown in Figure 15.34b. Also let the user pause/resume the animation with a button press/release and increase/decrease the car speed by pressing the UP and DOWN arrow keys.

## Example Output
![Sample Output](README.png)

## Analysis Steps
Create a car with shapes similar to figure 15.34. Then have the car move across the pane while being able to control the speed.

### Design
Had to create a second class for the car.

### Testing

## Notes
The car seems to jump when it goes from fully stopped to moving again.
